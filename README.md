## ✨ Key Features

## 🌐 SPA Routing System

The application uses **React Router 6** for smooth client-side navigation in SPA mode.

### 📁 File Structure
- `client/pages/Index.tsx` → Main Home Page  
- `client/App.tsx` → Central route configuration  
- `client/pages/` → All page-based routes  

Routes are registered using `react-router-dom` like this:

```tsx
import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Index />} />
  
  {/* ✅ All custom routes should be added above this catch-all */}
  <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
</Routes>
```

### 🔑 Notes:
- Always place your `*` (NotFound) route **last**.
- Each file inside `client/pages/` represents a single page.
- Keeps routing clean, scalable, and easy to maintain as the app grows.

### 🎨 Styling System

- **Primary Styling**: TailwindCSS 3 utility-first approach  
- **Theme & Design Tokens**: Centralized in `client/global.css`  
- **UI Components**: Reusable component library inside `client/components/ui/`  
- **Utility Function**: `cn()` merges `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` to handle conditional class names cleanly  

#### ✅ `cn()` Utility Example

```tsx
className={cn(
  "base-classes",
  { "conditional-class": condition },
  props.className // user overrides
)}
```

This ensures:
- Clean class management  
- No duplicate Tailwind classes  
- Easy conditional styling  

---

### ⚙️ Express Server Integration

The backend is seamlessly integrated with Vite for full-stack development.

- **Development Mode**: Runs on a **single port (8080)** for both frontend + backend  
- **Hot Reload**: Supports HMR for client and auto-restart for server  
- **API Route Prefix**: All backend routes are under `/api/`

#### Example API Endpoints

- `GET /api/ping` → Simple health check  
- `GET /api/demo` → Demo API endpoint  

---

### 🔗 Shared Types & Path Aliases

Shared TypeScript types can be used across both client and server:

```ts
import { DemoResponse } from "@shared/api";
```

#### Path Aliases

- `@shared/*` → Shared folder  
- `@/*` → Client folder  

This keeps your imports clean, scalable, and maintainable across the codebase.

## 🧑‍💻 Development Commands

Use these commands during development and production:

```bash
pnpm dev        # Start dev server (client + server)
pnpm build      # Production build
pnpm start      # Start production server
pnpm typecheck  # Run TypeScript type checks
pnpm test       # Run Vitest test suite
```

---

## ➕ Adding Features

### 🎨 Adding New Theme Colors

To extend the color palette:

1. Open `client/global.css`
2. Update `tailwind.config.ts`
3. Add or modify Tailwind color tokens as needed

This allows you to control and scale your design system from a single source of truth.

---

### 🌐 Adding a New API Route

If your API requires shared types, define them first.

1. **Create a shared interface** in `shared/api.ts`:

```ts
export interface MyRouteResponse {
  message: string;
  // Add other response properties here
}
```

2. Define your new Express route under `/api/*`  
3. Import the shared type in both client and server

Example usage:

```ts
import { MyRouteResponse } from "@shared/api";
```

This ensures:
- ✅ Full type safety across frontend & backend  
- ✅ Clean shared contract  
- ✅ No duplicated types  
2. Create a new route handler in `server/routes/my-route.ts`:

```ts
import { RequestHandler } from "express";
import { MyRouteResponse } from "@shared/api"; // optional: type safety

export const handleMyRoute: RequestHandler = (req, res) => {
  const response: MyRouteResponse = {
    message: "Hello from my endpoint!",
  };

  res.json(response);
};
```

---

3. Register the route in `server/index.ts`:

```ts
import { handleMyRoute } from "./routes/my-route";

// Inside the createServer function
app.get("/api/my-endpoint", handleMyRoute);
```

✅ This keeps all API routes namespaced under `/api/*` and easy to maintain.

---

4. Use the API in React components (with type safety):

```ts
import { MyRouteResponse } from "@shared/api";

const response = await fetch("/api/my-endpoint");
const data: MyRouteResponse = await response.json();

console.log(data.message);
```

This keeps your frontend and backend strongly typed and consistent.

---

## 📄 Creating a New Page Route

1. Create a new page inside `client/pages/MyPage.tsx`
2. Register it in `client/App.tsx`:

```tsx
<Route path="/my-page" element={<MyPage />} />
```

### ✅ Tips:
- Each page inside `client/pages/` represents one route.
- Keep your routes centralized inside `App.tsx`.
- Helps maintain clean navigation as your app grows.
